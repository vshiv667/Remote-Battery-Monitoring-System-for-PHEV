# Remote-Battery-Monitoring-System-for-PHEV
Remote Battery Monitoring System for Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV)

# Overview
 - Designed and fabricated a working model of Remote Battery Monitoring System for PHEV
 - Assembled hardware for interface of Arduino microcontroller with GSM module, Battery and Voltage divider circuit
 - Leveraged GSM based technology to remotely monitor vital battery parameters like State of Charge (SOC) via user-initiated text message
